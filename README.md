📊 Customer Insights & Retention Dashboard | Excel 
1️⃣ Title
Customer Insights & Retention Optimization Dashboard Using Excel

2️⃣ Executive Summary
🔎 Business Problem

Customer acquisition costs are increasing, while customer churn continues to impact long-term profitability. The business lacks a clear understanding of:

Which customers generate the highest Lifetime Value (LTV)

Which segments show higher churn risk

Which retention strategies deliver better long-term value

How purchase behavior varies by region and time

Without data-driven visibility, retention decisions are reactive rather than strategic.

💡 Solution

To address this, I built an interactive Excel dashboard that:

Segments customers by region, product category, and retention strategy

Measures Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

Analyzes churn risk patterns

Identifies high-value and high-risk segments

Enables dynamic filtering using slicers

The dashboard transforms raw transactional data into actionable business insights.

📈 Business Impact (Analytical Insights)

Higher purchase frequency strongly correlates with lower churn risk → loyalty behavior identified.

North America shows the highest average LTV → high-value geographic segment.

Electronics drives the highest average order value → premium spending behavior.

Evening purchase activity dominates → opportunity for targeted marketing campaigns.

Email-based retention strategies slightly outperform discount-based campaigns in driving LTV.

This analysis enables more efficient allocation of marketing budgets toward high-return segments.


3️⃣ Business Problem (Scenario Explanation)

In competitive markets, businesses struggle with:

High customer churn

Inefficient retention spending

Lack of segmentation clarity

Uniform marketing strategies across diverse customer groups

Without segmentation and behavioral analysis, companies risk investing equally in low-value and high-value customers.

This project simulates a real-world scenario where leadership requires:

Clear customer segmentation

Churn risk identification

Strategy performance comparison

Executive-level KPI visibility

4️⃣ Methodology
📊 Analytical Approach

This project uses:

Customer segmentation analysis

Behavioral trend analysis

Retention strategy comparison

KPI performance tracking

Descriptive statistical aggregation

🛠 Dashboard Development Approach

I designed a layered structure:

Raw Dataset Layer – Clean structured transactional data

Pivot Analysis Layer – Aggregation and metric computation

Dashboard Layer – Executive-friendly visualization

Why Excel?

Although BI tools exist, Excel was chosen because:

It remains widely used in business environments

PivotTables allow fast aggregation

Slicers provide interactive filtering

It demonstrates strong foundational analytical capability

The dashboard focuses on clarity, interactivity, and decision-making usability.

North America represents a high-LTV market and should receive prioritized retention efforts.

Electronics customers generate higher order values and may respond well to premium targeting strategies.

Evening purchase peaks suggest optimized campaign timing can increase engagement.

Email retention strategies show slightly better long-term value generation compared to discounts.

💡 Business Recommendations
