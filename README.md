Customer Insights & Retention Optimization Dashboard Using Excel

2️⃣ __Executive Summary__

🔎 __Business Problem__

Customer acquisition costs are increasing, while customer churn continues to impact long-term profitability. The business lacks a clear understanding of:
- Which customers generate the highest Lifetime Value (LTV)
- Which segments show higher churn risk
- Which retention strategies deliver better long-term value
- How purchase behavior varies by region and time
Without data-driven visibility, retention decisions are reactive rather than strategic.

💡 __Solution__

To address this, I built an interactive Excel dashboard that:
* Segments customers by region, product category, and retention strategy
* Measures Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)
* Analyzes churn risk patterns
* Identifies high-value and high-risk segments
* Enables dynamic filtering using slicers
The dashboard transforms raw transactional data into actionable business insights.

📈 __Business Impact (Analytical Insights)__
+ Higher purchase frequency strongly correlates with lower churn risk → loyalty behavior identified.
+ North America shows the highest average LTV → high-value geographic segment.
+ Electronics drives the highest average order value → premium spending behavior.
+ Evening purchase activity dominates → opportunity for targeted marketing campaigns.
+ Email-based retention strategies slightly outperform discount-based campaigns in driving LTV.

This analysis enables more efficient allocation of marketing budgets toward high-return segments.

3️⃣ __Business Problem (Scenario Explanation)__

In competitive markets, businesses struggle with:
- High customer churn
- Inefficient retention spending
- Lack of segmentation clarity
- Uniform marketing strategies across diverse customer groups

Without segmentation and behavioral analysis, companies risk investing equally in low-value and high-value customers.

This project simulates a real-world scenario where leadership requires:
* Clear customer segmentation
* Churn risk identification
* Strategy performance comparison
* Executive-level KPI visibility

4️⃣ __Methodology__

📊 __Analytical Approach__

This project uses:
- Customer segmentation analysis
- Behavioral trend analysis
- Retention strategy comparison
- KPI performance tracking
- Descriptive statistical aggregation

🛠 __Dashboard Development Approach__

I designed a layered structure:
1. Raw Dataset Layer – Clean structured transactional data
2. Pivot Analysis Layer – Aggregation and metric computation
3. Dashboard Layer – Executive-friendly visualization

Why Excel?
Although BI tools exist, Excel was chosen because:
+ It remains widely used in business environments
+ PivotTables allow fast aggregation
+ Slicers provide interactive filtering
+ It demonstrates strong foundational analytical capability
The dashboard focuses on clarity, interactivity, and decision-making usability.
